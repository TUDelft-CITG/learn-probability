    "Welcome to the Independence and Conditioning module.  At the end of this module, you will be able to evaluate probabilities for events for a given (joint) probability distribution using knowledge on independence and conditioning. Manipulate the distribution parameters to evaluate conditions relevant to Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) applications.\n",

    "We know that $P(X>x \\vert Y>y) = \\frac {P(X>x \\bigcap Y>y )}{P(Y>y)}$, and with the assumption of $X$ and $Y$ being independent, $P(X>x \\bigcap Y>y ) = P(X>x)P(Y>y)$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Just as in Question 2, $P(X>x \\vert Y>y) = \\frac {P(X>x \\bigcap Y>y )}{P(Y>y)}$, so we have the following problem to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X>0.8 \\vert Y>4.6) = \\frac {P(X>0.8 \\bigcap Y>4.6 )}{P(Y>4.6)} = \\frac {P(X>0.8 \\bigcap Y>4.6 )}{1-P(Y \\leq 4.6)}$.\n",
