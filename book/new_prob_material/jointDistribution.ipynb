    "Welcome to the Joint and Marginal Distribution module.  At the end of this module, you will be able to identify distribution parameters and evaluate joint probabilities for events using continuous distributions. Manipulate the distribution parameters to evaluate conditions relevant to Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) applications.\n",

    "1. The basic theory of a specific concept.\n",
