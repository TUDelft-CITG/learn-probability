# Probability and Statistics Applications for Civil Engineers

Welcome to **Probability and Statistics Applications for Civil Engineers**. We're excited to have you join us in this self-paced online course, which is designed to bridge the gap between introductory and more advanced courses in probability and statistics.

```{admonition} The label "Civil Engineering" is an oversimplification!
:class: dropdown
The field of civil engineering has changed significantly since over the past decades. While we wish we could have included titles such as "environmental engineering," "construction management," "engineering geology" or similar fields, please forgive us for adopting the label "civil engineering" for the sake of simplicity.
```

This course was originally designed for incoming students to several MSc programs at TU Delft: especially those who have never taken a university-level course on probability and statistics concepts, but also those who may need to brush up on these concepts. Have you had trouble in the past due to the theoretical or math-oriented nature of these problems? Then this course is for you!

```{admonition} Note to TU Delft Students (MSc programs)
:class: dropdown
The specific MSc programs at TU Delft that this course is designed for include:

- Civil Engineering (CE)
- Environmental Engineering (EE)
- Applied Earth Sciences (AES)
- Construction Management Engineering (CME)

The first three programs are within the faculty of Civil Engineering & Geosciences (CEG), which begin with the module Modeling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers (MUDE).

CME is an interfaculty program between 1) CEG, 2) Architecture & the Built Environment (ABE) and 3) Technology, Policy & Management (TPM), which begins with the course *Managing* Uncertainty and Data (MUD).

The current edition of this course (Probability and Statistics Applications for Civil Engineers) includes many references to CEG and MUDE; these will be removed as development continues, but the content will remain the same.

This course assumes some prior knowledge of probability and statistics. Although most of the example calculations illustrated in this course use Python, prior experience with this programming language is not necessary. Python is used because it is adopted in many university-level engineering programs, so we want you to feel comfortable with seeing and making calculations using code before the academic year begins. In other words: in this course, think of Python as a powerful calculator, and you will always be able to understand what the code is doing simply by reading it (not running it).

% If you would like to learn more about Python enroll for our companion course, Python Applications for MUDE.

This course will enable you to...

* Identify important probability and statistics theorems and methods that are commonly used for applications in civil engineering

* Solve basic probability and statistic problemsâ€¯for applications in civil engineering using concepts such as total probability, Bayes' rule, continuous and discrete distributions, etc.

* Have sufficient prior probability and statistics knowledge to succeed in a MSc-level engineering program at TU Delft.

## Course overview

Section 1. General concepts.

Section 2. Discrete random variables.

Section 3. Continuous random variables.

```{warning} This course is under development: new modules will be added during spring of 2023, and references to MUDE and other TU Delft-specific programs will be slowly phased out. We anticipate "version 2"to be completed in July, 2023.

## Module set up

This online course is divided by general concepts into Sections, for example, continuous or discrete distributions. Each Section contains a number of Modules. Although the modules are of different lengths, all of them are set up with a consistent 3-unit format:

1.    The basic theory of a specific concept.
2.    Example of how a specific concept is applied to a civil engineering problem, through step-by-step explanations and short python code blocks.
3.    Introduction of a new problem, to practice using the method from unit 2.

Depending on your background in probability and statistics, most of the modules can be completed independently. 

In summary, the course is made up of a number of (mostly) independent modules that are grouped into several sections, all of which have the same 3-unit structure.

Remember that while we will review many important fundamental concepts, this is not a complete course in probability and statistics.
