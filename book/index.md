# Probability and statistics applications for Modelling, Uncertainty, Data for Engineers (MUDE)

Welcome to **Probability and statistics applications for Modelling, Uncertainty, Data for Engineers (MUDE)**. We're excited to have you join us in this course, which is designed to bridge the gap between introductory and more advanced courses in probability and statistics.

This course is designed for incoming students to one of three MSc programs in the Civil Engineering and Geosciences Faculty (CEG) of TU Delft, especially those who have never taken a university-level course on probability and statistics concepts, but also those who may need to brush up on these concepts. Have you had trouble in the past due to the theoretical or math-oriented nature of these problems? Then this course is for you!

This course assumes some prior knowledge of probability and statistics. Although most of the example calculations illustrated in this course use Python, prior experience with this programming language is not necessary. Python is used because it will be part of the MUDE module, so we want you to feel comfortable with seeing and making calculations using code before the academic year begins. If you would like to learn more about Python enroll for our companion course, Python Applications for MUDE.
This course will enable you to...

*   Identify important probability and statistics theorems and methods that are commonly used for applications in Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG).

*    Solve basic probability and statistic problemsâ€¯for applications in CEG using concepts such as total probability, Bayes' rule, continuous and discrete distributions, etc.

*    Have sufficient prior probability and statistics knowledge to succeed in Modelling, Uncertainty, Data for Engineers, the first module in one of the three CEG MSc programs at TU Delft.

## Module set up

This online course is divided by general concepts into Sections, for example, continuous or discrete distributions. Each Section contains a number of Modules. Although the modules are of different lengths, all of them are set up with a consistent 3-unit format:

1.    The basic theory of a specific concept.
2.    Example of how a specific concept is applied to a Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) problem, through step-by-step explanations and short python code blocks.
3.    Introduction of a new problem, to practice using the method from unit 2.

Depending on your background in probability and statistics, most of the modules can be completed independently. 

In summary, the course is made up of a number of (mostly) independent modules that are grouped into several sections, all of which have the same 3-unit structure.

Remember that while we will review many important fundamental concepts, this is not a complete course in probability and statistics.
