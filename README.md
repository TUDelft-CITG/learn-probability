# README

This repository contains the source for the website [Probability and Statistics Applications for MUDE](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-probability/). The website is a self-paced online course, which is meant to be a way to refresh knowledge of BSc-level probability and statistics concepts.

MUDE (Modeling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers) is a course (technically it's called a "module") that is part of the MSc programs in the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. One of the pre-requisites is BSc-level probability and statistics, and this online course was developed to support incoming students in need of a refresher.

## More will be added here later

The website is made using Jupyter Book.
