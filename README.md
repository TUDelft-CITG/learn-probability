# README

This repository contains the source for the website [Probability and Statistics Applications for Civil Engineers](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-probability/). The website is a self-paced online course, which is meant to be a way to refresh knowledge of BSc-level probability and statistics concepts. In spite of the name, this course focuses on providing applications of statistics and probability theory for many fields in, and related to, civil engineering. In particular it is inspired by the applied earth science and environmental engineering programs at TU Delft.

This course was originally created to support incoming students to the MSc programs at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. In the first year, students of all three programs take a course CEGM1000: Modeling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers (MUDE), a module introduced in the new MSc curriculum starting with the 202223 school year. One of the pre-requisites is BSc-level probability and statistics, and this online course was developed to support incoming students in need of a refresher.

## More will be added here later

The website is made using Jupyter Book.
