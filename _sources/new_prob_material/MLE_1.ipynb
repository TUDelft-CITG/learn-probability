    "Welcome to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation module.  At the end of this module, you will be able to calculate the likelihood function for a given probability distribution and use it to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. Manipulate the distribution parameters to evaluate conditions relevant to Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) applications.\n",

    "This module is set up with a 3-unit format:\n",

    "1. The basic theory of a specific concept.\n",
    "2. Example of how a specific concept is applied to a  CEG problem, through step-by-step explanations and short python code blocks.\n",

    "## 1. Theory\n",
    "Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution based on observed data $\\mathbf{x} = x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Evaluating the joint density of the data given a parametric family $\\theta$ gives the likelihood function, which is a function that measures how well the observed data fits the probability distribution with the given parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i \\mid \\theta)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of MLE is to find the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. The maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the set of parameters for which the observed data is the most probable with the assumed probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg \\max _{\\theta} L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is more common to use the log-likelihood, which is the natural logarithm of the likelihood function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ln (L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x})) = \\ln (\\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i \\mid \\theta))$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$, the following steps should be taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the likelihood function $L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "2. Take natural logarithm of the likelihood function to get the log-likelihood function $\\ln (L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x}))$.\n",
    "3. Differentiate the log-likelihood function and set it to zero: $\\frac{\\partial L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n",
    "4. Solve the equation for $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the maximum can also occur at the boundary of the domain.\n",

    "The exponential PDF is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_X(x, \\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$ for $x>0$\n",

    "2. Take natural logarithm of the likelihood function to get the log-likelihood function $\\ln (L(\\lambda \\mid \\mathbf{x}))$.\n",

    "4. Solve the equation for $\\hat{\\lambda}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Define the likelihood function $L(\\lambda \\mid \\mathbf{x})$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition, the likelihood function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(\\lambda \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i \\mid \\lambda)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the exponential distribution, $f(x_i \\mid \\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the likelihood function for the exponential distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(\\lambda \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x_i} = \\lambda^n e^{-\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i} = $\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\ln (L(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x})) = \\ln (\\lambda^n e^{-\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i} ) = n \\ln (\\lambda) -\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $\n",

    "We have the following equation to solve:\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\hat \\lambda = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i} = \\frac{1}{\\bar x}$\n",
